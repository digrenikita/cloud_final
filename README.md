**Current IT Set up and Recommendations**
In this section we analyze several elements of the current IT setup and offer suggestions for potential deployments.

**Recommendation**
When demand is high, cloud computing has many benefits for online travel agencies. These websites can successfully handle growing traffic and demand by utilizing AWS EC2 which comes with an auto-scaling option and resources can be automatically added at peak demand times and reduced during low demand times ,improving cost effectiveness. They can also consider adopting serverless architecture by using services such as AWS Lambda which automatically scale based on incoming requests and only charge for the actual compute time used. This can be cost-effective during the low-traffic periods.
Assuring excellent availability and responsiveness, load balancing divides incoming traffic among several servers. By distributing frequently used data and static material, catching and content delivery networks (CDNS) reduce the time it takes for web page to load.Data retrieval  
Is made easy by the automatic scaling of cloud databases to handle rising query volumes.Global reach makes it possible for users everywhere to experience reduced latency. Even if some of the infrastructure fails, tolerance and high availability guarantee ongoing operations. Monitoring tools offer in -the -moment performance information that helps with the optimization and bottle neck detection.In the end, cloud computing provides scalability and flexibility, which makes it the perfect answer for online travel agencies with  seasonal fluctuation in customer traffic.
